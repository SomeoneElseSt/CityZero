# What?
A tool to download images of a city from Mapillary and sticht them together into a 3D model of that city using [Gaussian Splatting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkIJbpdTujE)

# Why?
To create realistic city replicas that can be used to simulate traffic, pedestrians, and down the line more complex social interactions within the model.
